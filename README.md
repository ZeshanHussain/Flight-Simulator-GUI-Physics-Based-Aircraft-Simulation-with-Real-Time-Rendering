# Flight-Simulator-GUI-Physics-Based-Aircraft-Simulation-with-Real-Time-Rendering
A 60Hz physics engine with 6-DOF dynamics and ImGui instrumentation. I built a fully functional flight simulator from scratch using C++, OpenGL, and ImGui. It's a physics-accurate simulation that models real aircraft behavior using 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) dynamics.
